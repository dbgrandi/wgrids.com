				<h2>Win/Mac Developers</h2>
				Type: <b>Full time</b><br/>

				Experience: <b>3+ years</b>
				<b>Description:</b>
				<p>
					We are looking to hire some developers that know more about building
					OS specific apps than we do. Specifically, you will be working on
					creating prototypes for concepts we have that need internal vetting.
					You'll also be taking those concept apps and making them feel like
					they <em>belong</em> on Windows or OS X. We like to hack quick ideas
					together, but we also like to build proper software once we are
					comfortable with those ideas. So, you'll be doing a combination of
					quick scripting based apps and solid development.

					Both:
					<ul>
						<li>Bundling applications for internal deployment</li>
						<li>Comfortable with distributed version control (we heart git + github)</li>
						<li>Capable of independent action, research, and knowledge sharing</li>
						<li>Has some experience with XMPP, STUN/TURN/ICE and other necessary evils</li>
						<li>Experience with extending and integrating with OS internals (file
						system, services, networking)</li>
					</ul>
					Windows Warrior:
					<ul>
						<li>.Net via C#, C++</li>
						<li>Comfortable with scripting (IronPython/IronRuby experience a plus)</li>
						<li>It's likely that you already have cygwin installed</li>
					</ul>
					Mac Marvel:
					<ul>
					<li>Obj-C, regular old C, Ruby (or even MacRuby)</li>
					<li>Sparkle and custom installers</li>
					<li>You may have a strong opinion on Ports vs. Fink</li>	
					</ul>

						Slicehost/EC2, but we need a dedicated person to take us to the next
						level of growth.						
					</P>
					<b>Requirements and Skills:</b>
